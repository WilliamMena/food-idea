Ideas

Original idea was to list items in your fridge and have the program find recipes for you to try.
Current Idea is have a user list up to 5 ingrediants and the computer will list the first 3(maybe 5) recipes
on the site. For now 1 site, maybe two.
Features in the far future will be have the program create a food schedule for you depending on eating
5 times a day or 3 big meals. Can be schedule for the day or for the week but that's a bit more complicated.
I want my CLI to show 3 or 5 recipe ideas listed form 1-5 and if none are good, press option 5 or 6
to show what's next on the list. Another 5. Currently food network give's 10 recipes on their search results.

When adding items into the search bar in foodnetwork.com it goes in between the searchTerm= and &form=
So for every item the user inputs, we can enter a plus inbetween each item
